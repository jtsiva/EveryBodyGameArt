# EveryBodyGameArt
A free to use collection of game art of diverse characters

The intention behind this project is to collect open game art of various styles that represents humans in every form that take on this planet. I know we can do a lot better than what is out there right now and making it open will hopefully mean that this art will be adopted widely.

For contributors:
- Each style folder will include an example of the art style needed
- Taking the base style, we need variation in:
  - skin color
  - eye color
  - hair color and styles
  - torsos that vary across masculine, feminine, and girth
  - limbs
  - and more as we discuss how we can make sure every body is represented in game art
- Open a pull request when you are ready to contribute your art
- Feel free to open an Issue to ask questions!
